    "While the beginning of this course may at times seem dry, confusing, or overwhelming, think about it like your middle school English class. It's important that we know what verbs and nouns are when we want to form more complex thoughts.  However, just like I don't know what a \"predicate\" is, we don't need to know every tiny detail of coding to make it work for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advice: I recommend that you try to find a small group to work with early on, as it will help you reinforce these concepts before we get to more complex ones."
